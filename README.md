# Mr-Clean-Lobbying-Analysis

The goal of this project is two-fold:

1. To gather all available lobbying data and present it in as comprehensible and visual fashion as possible
2. To measure relations between lobbying and bills passed in Congress to demonstrate the impacts of lobbying in a more tangible manner

Much of the data on lobbying comes from [OpenSecrets.org](https://www.opensecrets.org), a group that works to bring light to all the money moving around in politics. A data dictionary explaining what each of the datasets' variables mean can be found [here](https://www.opensecrets.org/open-data/bulk-data-documentation).
